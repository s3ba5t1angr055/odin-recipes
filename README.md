# HTML-Project odin-recipe

In this project I am going to recap all the things I know so far regarding HTML. 

I created and index.html with links to three html-sites which each contain a recipe for a dish. Each recipe contains a picture of the finished dish, an unordered list for the ingredients and an ordered list for the steps on how to make them. 

The recipes are written in german.
